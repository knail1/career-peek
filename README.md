## 📝 Meta-work: How I Built the Planning Docs

The planning process for Career Peek involved several key steps to ensure a well-structured and purposeful application:

### Initial Concept Development

The project began with brainstorming sessions to identify the core problem: many people struggle to find clear, actionable information about potential career paths. I mapped out user personas and their needs, which helped shape the application's features and focus.

### Research and Data Collection

I conducted extensive research on:
- Career development frameworks
- Job market data sources
- Skill taxonomies and competency models
- Existing career guidance tools and their limitations

This research informed both the technical architecture and content strategy for the application.

### Prompt Engineering

For the AI-powered components of Career Peek, I developed a series of carefully crafted prompts designed to:

1. **Extract meaningful insights** from user inputs about their interests, skills, and goals
2. **Generate personalized career recommendations** based on user profiles and current job market data
3. **Provide actionable next steps** for users to explore recommended career paths
4. **Maintain conversational flow** while gathering necessary information

The prompt development process involved:
- Creating base templates for different interaction types
- Testing with diverse user scenarios
- Refining based on output quality and user feedback
- Implementing guardrails to ensure helpful, accurate responses

### Iterative Design Process

The planning documents evolved through multiple iterations, with each version incorporating feedback from potential users and subject matter experts. This iterative approach helped refine both the technical specifications and the user experience design.
